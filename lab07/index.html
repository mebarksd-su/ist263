        <p>I am a sophomore at the iSchool studying Applied Data Analytics. I chose this major because I am interested in studying analytics related to finances and or politics. A summary of my skills includes python, SQL, and financial accounting. Outside of school work I am a research assistant for Professor Banks in the LinkLab. In my personal life, 
             I am a <strong>huge</strong> fan of video games and movies. I spend most of my free time doing either one. My <strong>favorite</strong> movie would be War of the Planet of the Apes, my favorite show would be The Sopranos, and my favorite video game would be Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>
